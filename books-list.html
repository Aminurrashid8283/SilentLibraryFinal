                          during their honeymoon, right before he stole her elderly aunt's earrings and abandoned her.
                          Now, five years later, the enigmatic man who'd broken her heart and destroyed her trust is
                          back. But she's not the same naive young woman who fell for him so easily. Marrying Evangeline
                          and letting her think he was nothing but a common thief had been James Bishop's plan all
                          along. As an assassin for the Committee, a covert agency dedicated to stamping out
                          international crime, he had no business even thinking about marriage. But it was the only way
                          to protect Evangeline after she'd unwittingly wandered into his operation against a group of
                          human traffickers, placing herself in grave danger. And now that James's vigilant watch over
                          Evangeline's life has revealed to his enemies that she's his one true weakness, he must set
                          out to have, to hold, and -- above all -- to protect his bride"</p>

                          their constant arguing could mask a mutual attraction. But when one quarrel ends in a sudden
                          kiss, Cat is shocked at her powerful response -- and even more so when Leo proposes a
                          dangerous liaison.</p>

                          second novel, tells the poignant and fascinating story of a young man who is caught between
                          the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic family and the impact of
                          Western ideas. In consequence, he feels himself "disqualified from being human" (a literal

                          The Setting Sun, has said of the author's work: "His world . . . suggests Chekhov or possibly

                          unlike any Western book." His writing is in some ways reminiscent of Rimbaud, while he himself
                          has often been called a forerunner of Yukio Mishima.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">"Evangeline Morrissey remembers the last time she saw her husband: it was during
                    their honeymoon, right before he stole her elderly aunt's earrings and abandoned her. Now, five
                    years later, the enigmatic man who'd broken her heart and destroyed her trust is back. But she's not
                    the same naive young woman who fell for him so easily. Marrying Evangeline and letting her think he
                    was nothing but a common thief had been James Bishop's plan all along. As an assassin for the
                    Committee, a covert agency dedicated to stamping out international crime, he had no business even
                    thinking about marriage. But it was the only way to protect Evangeline after she'd unwittingly
                    wandered into his operation against a group of human traffickers, placing herself in grave danger.
                    And now that James's vigilant watch over Evangeline's life has revealed to his enemies that she's
                    his one true weakness, he must set out to have, to hold, and -- above all -- to protect his bride"

                  <p class="card-text">Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human, this leading postwar Japanese writer's second
                    novel, tells the poignant and fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of
                    the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic family and the impact of Western ideas. In
                    consequence, he feels himself "disqualified from being human" (a literal translation of the Japanese
                    title). Donald Keene, who translated this and Dazai's first novel, The Setting Sun, has said of the
                    author's work: "His world . . . suggests Chekhov or possibly postwar France, . . . but there is a
                    Japanese sensibility in the choice and presentation of the material. A Dazai novel is at once
                    immediately intelligible in Western terms and quite unlike any Western book." His writing is in some
                    ways reminiscent of Rimbaud, while he himself has often been called a forerunner of Yukio Mishima.
